Identifying trust circle is the basis for determining target audience to advertise any product. The optimization of selecting a small subset of most influential users (seed users) in a social network so as to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions via social influence and the classification of this influence into positive and negative domain will lead us to better graph topology. Calculation of influence and determining its threshold is not exhaustive. Different attributes and features among two entities can play distinct roles in evolving the network shape. Hence, it would be useful to develop a data driven model to distinguish accurate influential sphere for analysis of common social behavior pattern.
